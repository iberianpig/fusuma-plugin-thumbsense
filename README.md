# Fusuma::Plugin::Thumbsense [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense) [![Build Status](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Remapper from key to click only while tapping the touchpad.  
Implemented as [Fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma) Plugin.

**THIS PLUGIN IS EXPERIMENTAL.**

## What is ThumbSense?
[ThumbSense](https://www2.sonycsl.co.jp/person/rekimoto/tsense/soft/index.html) is a tool that lets you control a laptop's touchpad using the keyboard. It assigns certain keyboard keys as mouse buttons and switches between acting as mouse buttons or normal keyboard keys based on whether the user's thumb is touching the touchpad. ThumbSense aims to make it easier to use the touchpad without moving your hand away from the keyboard.

  - fusuma-plugin-keypress is used to get keyboard input and is installed automatically.
- [fusuma-plugin-remap](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-remap)
  - You need to set up udev rules for creating a virtual input device.
