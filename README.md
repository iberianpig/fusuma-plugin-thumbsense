# Fusuma::Plugin::Thumbsense [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense) [![Build Status](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense/actions/workflows/ubuntu.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense/actions/workflows/ubuntu.yml)

**THIS PLUGIN IS EXPERIMENTAL.**

ThumbSense plugin for [Fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma)

ThumbSense is a tool that lets you control a laptop's touchpad using the keyboard. It assigns certain keyboard keys as mouse buttons and switches between acting as mouse buttons or normal keyboard keys based on whether the user's thumb is touching the touchpad. ThumbSense aims to make it easier to use the touchpad without moving your hand away from the keyboard.

## Installation

Run the following code in your terminal.

### Install fusuma-plugin-thumbsense

This plugin requires [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma#update) 2.0 or later and [fusuma-plugin-keypress](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-keypress) 0.5 or later.

```sh
$ sudo gem install fusuma-plugin-thumbsense
```

### Add show-keycodes option

Open `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml` and add the following code at the bottom.

```yaml
plugin:
  inputs:
    libinput_command_input:
      show-keycodes: true
```

**NOTE: fusuma can read your keyboard inputs if show-keycodes option is true**

## Properties

### Thumbsense
Add `thumbsense:` property in `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml`.

## Example

Set `thumbsense:` property and values under gesture in `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml`.

```yaml
thumbsense:
  J: 
    command: 
      echo 'J key is pressed while touching touchpad'
  K:
    command: 
      echo 'K key is pressed while touching touchpad'

plugin:
  inputs:
    libinput_command_input:
      show-keycodes: true
```

### TODO

- Using the fusuma-plugin-sendkey to emulate mouse buttons
- Creating a simple key remapper using evdev and uinput to prevent the pressing of J/K keys on the physical keyboard from being sent.
