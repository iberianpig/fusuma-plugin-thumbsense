# Fusuma::Plugin::Thumbsense [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense) [![Build Status](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Remapper from key to click only while tapping the touchpad.  
Implemented as [Fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma) Plugin.

**THIS PLUGIN IS EXPERIMENTAL.**

## What is ThumbSense?
[ThumbSense](https://www2.sonycsl.co.jp/person/rekimoto/tsense/soft/index.html) is a tool that lets you control a laptop's touchpad using the keyboard. It assigns certain keyboard keys as mouse buttons and switches between acting as mouse buttons or normal keyboard keys based on whether the user's thumb is touching the touchpad. ThumbSense aims to make it easier to use the touchpad without moving your hand away from the keyboard.

## Properties

### Thumbsense context

First, add the thumbsense `context` to `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml`.
The `context` is separated by `---` and specified by `context: thumbsense`.
Fusuma will switch to the `thumbsense` context while tapping the touchpad.

### Remap key to mouse button

You can remap keys to mouse buttons while tapping the touchpad.
The `remap` property is specified in the `thumbsense` context.

Available mouse buttons are:

- `BTN_LEFT`
- `BTN_MIDDLE`
- `BTN_RIGHT`
- `BTN_SIDE`
- `BTN_EXTRA`
- `BTN_FORWARD`
- `BTN_BACK`
- `BTN_TASK`
- `BTN_0`
- `BTN_1`
-   ...
- `BTN_9`

## Example

Set the following code in `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml`.

```yaml
# add thumbsense context

---
context: thumbsense

remap:
  F: BTN_LEFT
  E: BTN_MIDDLE
  D: BTN_RIGHT
  SPACE: BTN_LEFT
  J: BTN_LEFT
  K: BTN_RIGHT
```

## TODO

- thumbsense
  - [x] change layer of remap while tapping
  - [ ] make it possible to execute executor like `command:` `sendkey:`

- remap
  - [x] remap to single key like `remap: { J: BTN_LEFT }` 
  - [x] send BTN_LEFT/BTN_MIDDLE/BTN_RIGHT click `remap: { I: BTN_MIDDLE }`
  - [ ] remap multiple keys like `remap: { H: LEFTCTRL+TAB }`
  - [ ] remap POINTER_MOTION to POINTER_SCROLL_FINGER `remap: { S: POINTER_SCROLL_FINGER }`
