# Fusuma::Plugin::Thumbsense [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense) [![Build Status](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense/actions/workflows/main.yml)

**THIS PLUGIN IS EXPERIMENTAL.**

ThumbSense plugin for [Fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma)

ThumbSense is a tool that lets you control a laptop's touchpad using the keyboard. It assigns certain keyboard keys as mouse buttons and switches between acting as mouse buttons or normal keyboard keys based on whether the user's thumb is touching the touchpad. ThumbSense aims to make it easier to use the touchpad without moving your hand away from the keyboard.

  - fusuma-plugin-keypress is used to get keyboard input and is installed automatically.
- [fusuma-plugin-remap](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-remap)
  - /dev/uinput is required to write to the virtual device. Please refer to [fusuma-plugin-remap's README](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-remap?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-udev-rules) for details.

```


## Properties

### Thumbsense

First, add the `thumbsense` context to `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml`.
The context is separated by `---` and specified by `context: thumbsense`.

## Example

Set the following code in `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml`.

```yaml
---
context: thumbsense

remap:
  J: BTN_LEFT
  K: BTN_RIGHT
```

### TODO

- Using the fusuma-plugin-sendkey to emulate mouse buttons
- Creating a simple key remapper using evdev and uinput to prevent the pressing of J/K keys on the physical keyboard from being sent.
